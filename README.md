# Traffic-Simulator
------------------

An application simulating a two-sided online market for electric vehicle charging.
Under development.

Developed using the "Simulation of Urban Mobility" (SUMO) road traffic simulation package.
Using the TraCI ("Traffic Control Interface") to interact with the simulation.

## En-Route Charging
Electric Vehicles enter the simulation from a source, heading to a destination, are rerouted to a charging station, and stop to charge before arriving to their final destination.
